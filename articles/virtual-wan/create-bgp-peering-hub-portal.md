# How to create BGP peering with virtual hub (Preview) - Azure portal

This article helps you configure an Azure Virtual WAN hub router to peer with a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in your virtual network using the Azure portal. The virtual hub router learns routes from the NVA in a spoke VNet that is connected to a virtual WAN hub. The virtual hub router also advertises the virtual network routes to the NVA. For more information, see [Scenario: BGP peering with a virtual hub](scenario-bgp-peering-hub.md).

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The BGP peering with Virtual WAN hub feature is currently in gated public preview. If you are interested in trying this feature, please email **previewbgpwithvhub@microsoft.com** along with the Resource ID of your Virtual WAN resource. 
>
> To locate the Resource ID, open the Azure portal, navigate to your Virtual WAN resource, and click **Settings > Properties > Resource ID.**<br> Example: `/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualWans/<virtualWANname>`
>

Verify that you have met the following criteria before beginning your configuration:

[!INCLUDE [Before you begin](../../includes/virtual-wan-before-include.md)]

## <a name="openvwan"></a>Create a virtual WAN

[!INCLUDE [Create a virtual WAN](../../includes/virtual-wan-create-vwan-include.md)]

## <a name="hub"></a>Create a hub

A hub is a virtual network that can contain gateways for site-to-site, ExpressRoute, or point-to-site functionality. Once the hub is created, you'll be charged for the hub, even if you don't attach any sites.

[!INCLUDE [Create a hub](../../includes/virtual-wan-tutorial-s2s-hub-include.md)]

## <a name="vnet"></a>Connect the VNet to the hub

In this section, you create a connection between your hub and VNet.

## Configure a BGP peer

1.	Open the [Azure preview portal](https://aka.ms/azurecortexv2) using [https://aka.ms/azurecortexv2](https://aka.ms/azurecortexv2). The BGP peering with Virtual WAN hub feature is currently in managed preview and the configuration pages are not available in the regular Azure portal.

1.	On the portal page for your virtual WAN, in the **Connectivity** section, select **Hubs** to view the list of hubs. Click a hub to configure a BGP peer.

1.	On the **Virtual Hub** page, under the **Routing** section, select **BGP Peers** and click **+ Add** to add a BGP peer.

1.	On the **Add BGP Peer** page, complete all the fields.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-bgp-peering-hub-portal/add-peer.png" alt-text="4.":::

    * **Name** – Resource name to identify a specific BGP peer. 
    * **ASN** – The ASN for the BGP peer.
    * **IPv4 address** – The IPv4 address of the BGP peer.
    * **Virtual Network connection** – Choose the connection identifier that corresponds to the Virtual network that hosts the BGP peer.

1.	Click **Add** to complete the BGP peer configuration and view the peer.

## Modify a BGP peer

1. On the **Virtual Hub** resource, click **BGP Peers** and select the BGP peer. Click **…** then **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-bgp-peering-hub-portal/modify.png" alt-text="Screenshot of edit.":::

1. Once the BGP peer is modified, click **Add** to save.

## Delete a BGP peer

1. On the **Virtual Hub** resource, click **BGP Peers** and select the BGP peer. Click **…** then **Delete**.
