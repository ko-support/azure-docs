# Recommended approaches for creating custom images
This article describes the following recommended approaches for creating a custom image:

-   Create and save a custom image from a [lab’s template virtual machine (VM)](how-to-create-manage-template.md).
-   Bring a custom image from outside of the context of a lab by using:
    - An [Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/).
    - A VHD in your physical lab environment.

## Save a custom image from a lab's template VM 

Using a lab’s template VM to create and save a custom image is the simplest way to create an image because it is supported using Lab Services' portal.  As a result, both IT departments and educators can create custom images using a lab’s template VM.

For example, you can start with one of the Marketplace images and then install additional software applications, tooling, etc. that are needed for a class.  After you’ve finished setting up the image, you can save it in the [connected shared image gallery](how-to-attach-detach-shared-image-gallery.md) so that you and other educators can use the image to create new labs.

There are a few key points to be aware of with this approach:
-   Azure Lab Services automatically saves a *specialized* image when you export the image from the template VM.  In most cases, specialized images are well-suited for creating new labs because the image retains machine-specific information and user profiles.  Using a specialized image helps to ensure that the installed software will run the same when you use the image to create new labs.  If you need to create a *generalized* image, you must use one of the other recommended approaches in this article to create a custom image.

    You can create labs based on both generalized and specialized images in Azure Lab Services.  For more information about the differences, read the article [Generalized and specialized images](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md#generalized-and-specialized-images).

-   For more advanced scenarios with setting up your image, you may find it helpful to instead create an image outside of labs using either an Azure VM or a VHD from your physical lab environment.  Read the next sections for more information.

### How to save a custom image from a lab's template VM

You can use a lab's template VM to create either Windows or Linux custom images.  For more information, read the article on [how to save the image to a shared image gallery](how-to-use-shared-image-gallery.md#save-an-image-to-the-shared-image-gallery).

## Bring a custom image from an Azure VM

Another approach is to use an Azure VM to set up a custom image.  After you’ve finished setting up the image, you can save it to a shared image gallery so that you and your colleagues can use the image to create new labs.

Using an Azure VM gives you more flexibility:
-   You can create either [generalized or specialized](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md#generalized-and-specialized-images) images.  Otherwise, if you use a lab’s template VM to [export an image](how-to-use-shared-image-gallery.md) the image is always specialized.
-   You have access to more advanced features of an Azure VM that may be helpful for setting up an image.  For example, you can use [extensions](../virtual-machines/extensions/overview.md) to do post-deployment configuration and automation.  Also, you can access the VM’s [boot diagnostics](../virtual-machines/boot-diagnostics.md) and [serial console](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview).

However, setting up an image using an Azure VM is more complex.  As a result, IT departments are typically responsible for creating custom images on an Azure VMs.

### How to bring a custom image from an Azure VM

Here are the high-level steps to bring a custom image from an Azure VM:

1.  Create an [Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/) using a Windows or Linux Marketplace image.  
1.  Connect to the Azure VM and install additional software.  You can also make other customizations that are needed for your lab.  
1.  When you’ve finished setting up the image, [save the VM's image to a shared image gallery](../virtual-machines/image-version-vm-powershell.md).  As part of this, you will also need to create the image’s definition and version.
1.  Once the custom image is saved in the gallery, your image can be used to create new labs.   

The steps vary depending on if you are creating a custom Windows or Linux image.  Read the following articles for the detailed steps:

-   [How to bring a custom Windows image from an Azure VM](how-to-bring-custom-windows-image-azure-vm.md)
-   [How to bring a custom Linux image from an Azure VM](how-to-bring-custom-linux-image-azure-vm.md)

## Bring a custom image from a VHD in your physical lab environment

The third approach to consider, is to bring a custom image from a VHD in your physical lab environment to a shared image gallery.  Once the image is in a shared image gallery, you and other educators can use the image to create new labs.

Here are a few reasons why you may want to use this approach:

-   You can create either [generalized or specialized](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md#generalized-and-specialized-images) images to use in your labs.  Otherwise, if you use a [lab’s template VM](how-to-use-shared-image-gallery.md) to export an image, the image is always specialized.
-   You can access resources that exist within your on-prem environment.  For example, you may have large installation files in your on-prem environment that are too time consuming to copy to a lab’s template VM.
-   You can upload images created using other tools, such as [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction), so that you don’t have to manually set up an image using a lab’s template VM.

Bringing a custom image from a VHD is the most advanced approach because you must ensure that the image is set up properly so that it works within Azure.  As a result, IT departments are typically responsible for creating custom images from VHDs.

### How to bring a custom image from a VHD

Here are the high-level steps to bring a custom image from a VHD:

1.  Use [Windows Hyper-V](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) on your on-premises machine to create a Windows or Linux VHD.
1.  Connect to the Hyper-V VM and install additional software.  You can also make other customizations that are needed for your lab.  
1.  When you’ve finished setting up the image, upload the VHD to create a [managed disk](../virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview.md) in Azure.
1.  From the managed disk, create the [image’s definition](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md#image-definitions) and version in a shared image gallery.
1.  Once the custom image is saved in the gallery, the image can be used to create new labs.   

The steps vary depending on if you are creating a custom Windows or Linux image.  Read the following articles for the detailed steps:

-   [How to bring a custom Windows image from a VHD](upload-custom-image-shared-image-gallery.md)
-   [How to bring a custom Linux image from a VHD](how-to-bring-custom-linux-image-vhd.md)
