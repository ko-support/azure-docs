# Quickstart: Connect to the Azure Web PubSub instance from CLI

Previously we talked about how to create the Web PubSub instance [using Azure CLI](./quickstart-cli-create.md) or [from the portal](./howto-develop-create-instance.md). After the instance is successfully created, Azure CLI also provides a set of commands to connect to the instance and publish messages to the connected clients.

## Play with the instance

## Next steps

This quickstart provides you a basic idea of how to connect to the Web PubSub service and how to publish messages to the connected clients.
