# Knowledge store in Azure Cognitive Search

Knowledge store is a feature of Azure Cognitive Search that persists output from an [AI enrichment pipeline](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) into Azure Storage for independent analysis or downstream processing. An *enriched document* is a pipeline's output, created from content that has been extracted, structured, and analyzed using AI processes. In a standard AI pipeline, enriched documents are transitory, used only during indexing and then discarded. Creating a knowledge store preserves the enriched documents for inspection or for other knowledge mining scenarios.

If you have used cognitive skills in the past, you already know that *skillsets* move a document through a sequence of enrichments. The outcome can be a search index, or projections in a knowledge store. The two outputs, search index and knowledge store, are products of the same pipeline; derived from the same inputs, but resulting in output that is structured, stored, and used in different applications.

Physically, a knowledge store is [Azure Storage](../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md), either Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or both. Any tool or process that can connect to Azure Storage can consume the contents of a knowledge store.

Viewed through Storage Explorer, a knowledge store is just a collection of tables, objects, or files. The following example shows a knowledge store composed of three tables with fields that are either carried forward from the data source, or created through enrichments (see "sentiment score" and "translated_text").

## Benefits of knowledge store

A knowledge store gives you structure, context, and actual content - gleaned from unstructured and semi-structured data files like blobs, image files that have undergone analysis, or even structured data, reshaped into new forms. In a [step-by-step walkthrough](knowledge-store-create-rest.md), you can see first-hand how a dense JSON document is partitioned out into substructures, reconstituted into new structures, and otherwise made available for downstream processes like machine learning and data science workloads.

Although it's useful to see what an AI enrichment pipeline can produce, the real potential of a knowledge store is the ability to reshape data. You might start with a basic skillset, and then iterate over it to add increasing levels of structure, which you can then combine into new structures, consumable in other apps besides Azure Cognitive Search.

Enumerated, the benefits of knowledge store include the following:

+ Consume enriched documents in [analytics and reporting tools](#tools-and-apps) other than search. Power BI with Power Query is a compelling choice, but any tool or app that can connect to Azure Storage can pull from a knowledge store that you create.

+ Refine an AI-indexing pipeline while debugging steps and skillset definitions. A knowledge store shows you the product of a skillset definition in an AI-indexing pipeline. You can use those results to design a better skillset because you can see exactly what the enrichments look like. You can use [Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer.md?tabs=windows) in Azure Storage to view the contents of a knowledge store.

+ Shape the data into new forms. The reshaping is codified in skillsets, but the [Shaper skill](cognitive-search-skill-shaper.md) in Azure Cognitive Search provides explicit control and the ability to create multiple shapes. Shaping allows you to define a projection that aligns with your intended use of the data while preserving relationships.

## Knowledge store definition

During indexer execution, knowledge stores are created in your [Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-overview.md), using Azure Table Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or both. 

The data structures within Azure Storage are specified through the `projections` element of a `knowledgeStore` definition in a Skillset. [Projections](knowledge-store-projection-overview.md) can be articulated as tables, objects, or files, and you can have multiple sets (or *projection groups*) to create multiple data structures for different purposes.

```json
"knowledgeStore":{
   "storageConnectionString":"<YOUR-AZURE-STORAGE-ACCOUNT-CONNECTION-STRING>",
   "projections":[
      {
         "tables":[ ],
         "objects":[ ],
         "files":[ ]
      }
   }
```

The type of projection you specify in this structure determines the type of storage used by knowledge store.

+ `tables` project enriched content into Table Storage. Define a table projection when you need tabular reporting structures for inputs to analytical tools or export as data frames to other data stores. You can specify multiple `tables` within the same projection group to get a subset or cross section of enriched documents. Within the same projection group, table relationships are preserved so that you can work with all of them.

+ `objects` project JSON document into Blob storage. The physical representation of an `object` is a hierarchical JSON structure that represents an enriched document.

+ `files` project image files into Blob storage. A `file` is an image extracted from a document, transferred intact to Blob storage.

## Create a knowledge store

To create knowledge store, use the portal or an API. You will need [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml), a [skillset](cognitive-search-working-with-skillsets.md), and an [indexer](search-indexer-overview.md). Because indexers require a search index, you will also need to provide an index definition.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/kstore-portal)

[Create your first knowledge store in four steps](knowledge-store-connect-power-bi.md) using the **Import data** wizard. The wizard walks you through the following tasks:

1. Select a supported data source that provides the raw content.

1. Specify enrichment: attach a Cognitive Services resource, select skills, and specify a knowledge store. In this step, you will choose an Azure Storage account and choose whether to create objects, tables, or both.

1. Create an index schema. The wizard requires it and can infer one for you.

1. Run the wizard. Extraction, enrichment, and storage occur in this last step.

When you use the wizard, several additional tasks are handled internally that you would otherwise have to handle in code. Both shaping and projections (definitions of physical data structures in Azure Storage) are created for you. When you create a knowledge store manually, your code will need to cover these steps.

### [**REST**](#tab/kstore-rest)

REST API version `2020-06-30` can be used to create a knowledge store through additions to a skillset.

+ [Create Skillset (api-version=2020-06-30)](/rest/api/searchservice/create-skillset)
+ [Update Skillset (api-version=2020-06-30)](/rest/api/searchservice/update-skillset)

A `knowledgeStore` is defined within a [skillset](cognitive-search-working-with-skillsets.md), which in turn is invoked by an [indexer](search-indexer-overview.md). During enrichment, Azure Cognitive Search creates a space in your Azure Storage account and projects the enriched documents as blobs or into tables, depending on your configuration.

Tasks that your code will need to handle:

+ Specify the projections that you want built in Azure Storage (tables, objects, files)
+ Include a Shaper skill in your skillset to determine the schema and contents of the projection
+ Assign the named shape to a projection

An easy way to explore is to [create your first knowledge store using Postman](knowledge-store-create-rest.md).

### [**.NET SDK**](#tab/kstore-dotnet)

For .NET developers, use the [KnowledgeStore Class](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.models.knowledgestore) in the Azure.Search.Documents client library.

## Connect with apps

Once the enrichments exist in storage, any tool or technology that connects to Azure Blob or Table Storage can be used to explore, analyze, or consume the contents. The following list is a start:

+ [Storage Explorer](knowledge-store-view-storage-explorer.md) to view enriched document structure and content. Consider this as your baseline tool for viewing knowledge store contents.

+ [Power BI](knowledge-store-connect-power-bi.md) for reporting and analysis. 

+ [Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/index.yml) for further manipulation.

## Content lifecycle

Each time you run the indexer and skillset, the knowledge store is updated if the skillset or underlying source data has changed. Any changes picked up by the indexer are propagated through the enrichment process to the projections in the knowledge store, ensuring that your projected data is a current representation of content in the originating data source. 

> [!Note]
> While you can edit the data in the projections, any edits will be overwritten on the next pipeline invocation, assuming the document in source data is updated. 

### Changes in source data

For data sources that support change tracking, an indexer will process new and changed documents, and bypass existing documents that have already been processed. Timestamp information varies by data source, but in a blob container, the indexer looks at the `lastmodified` date to determine which blobs need to be ingested.

### Changes to a skillset

If you are making changes to a skillset, you should [enable caching of enriched documents](cognitive-search-incremental-indexing-conceptual.md) to reuse existing enrichments where possible.

Without incremental caching, the indexer will always process documents in order of the high water mark, without going backwards. For blobs, the indexer would process blobs sorted by `lastModified`, regardless of any changes to indexer settings or the skillset. If you change a skillset, previously processed documents aren't updated to reflect the new skillset. Documents processed after the skillset change will use the new skillset, resulting in index documents being a mix of old and new skillsets.

With incremental caching, and after a skillset update, the indexer will reuse any enrichments that are unaffected by the skillset change. Upstream enrichments are pulled from cache, as are any enrichments that are independent and isolated from the skill that was changed.

### Deletions

Although an indexer creates and updates structures and content in Azure Storage, it does not delete them. Projections continue to exist even when the indexer or skillset is deleted. As the owner of the storage account, you should delete a projection if it is no longer needed. 

## Next steps

Knowledge store offers persistence of enriched documents, useful when designing a skillset, or the creation of new structures and content for consumption by any client applications capable of accessing an Azure Storage account.

The simplest approach for creating enriched documents is [through the portal](knowledge-store-create-portal.md), but you can also use Postman and the REST API, which is more useful if you want insight into how objects are created and referenced programmatically.

Or, take a closer look at [projections](knowledge-store-projection-overview.md). To walk through an example that demonstrates advanced projections concepts like slicing, inline shaping, and relationships, start with [Define projections in a knowledge store](knowledge-store-projections-examples.md).
