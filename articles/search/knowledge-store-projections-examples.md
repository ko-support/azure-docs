# Define projections in a knowledge store

[Projections](knowledge-store-projection-overview.md) are the physical expression of enriched documents in a [knowledge store](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md) and take the form of tables, objects, or files in Azure Storage. Effective use of enriched documents requires structure. In this article, you'll explore both structure and relationships, learning how to build out projection properties, as well as how to relate data across the projection types created.

Projections are specified in a [knowledgeStore definition](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md), after you have defined enrichments and shaped the data using a [Shaper skill or inline shapes](knowledge-store-projection-shape.md). For context, this article references an example skillset that defines the enrichments, including a Shaper skill that produces a shape suitable for a projection.

## Enable caching

When developing projections, [set the indexer cache property](search-howto-incremental-index.md) to ensure cost control. Editing projections will result in the entire document being enriched again if the indexer cache is not set. When the cache is set and only the projections updated, skillset executions for previously enriched documents do not result in any new Cognitive Services charges.

## Example enrichments

To understand the intersection between data shapes and projections, refer to the following skillset as the basis for enriched content. This skillset processes both raw images and text, producing outputs that will be referenced in shapes and projections.

```json
{
    "name": "azureblob-skillset",
    "description": "Skillset that enriches blob data found in "merged_content". The enrichment granularity is a document.",

## Example Shaper skill

The Shaper skill is a utility for working with enriched content instead of creating it. Adding a Shaper to a skillset lets you create a custom shape that you can project into table storage. Without a custom shape, projections are limited to referencing a single node (one projection per output), which isn't suitable for tables. Creating a custom shape aggregates various elements into a new logical whole that can be projected as a single table, or sliced and distributed across a collection of tables. 

In this example, the custom shape combines blob metadata and identified entities and key phrases. The custom shape is called `projectionShape` and is parented under `/document`. 

One purpose of shaping is to ensure that all enrichment nodes are expressed in well-formed JSON, which is required for projecting into knowledge store. This is especially true when an enrichment tree contains nodes that are not well-formed JSON (for example, when an enrichment is parented to a primitive like a string).

Notice the last two nodes, `KeyPhrases` and `Entities`. These are wrapped into a valid JSON object with the `sourceContext`. This is required as `keyphrases` and `entities` are enrichments on primitives and need to be converted to valid JSON before they can be projected.

## Projecting to tables

Projecting to tables in Azure Storage is useful for reporting and analysis using tools like Power BI that can read from tables and discover relationships based on keys generated during projection. If you're trying to build a dashboard, working with related tables will simplify that task.

The schema of the table is specified partly by the projection (table name and key), and also by the source that provides the shape of table (columns).

> [!NOTE] 
> Table projections are Azure Storage tables, governed by the storage limits imposed by Azure Storage. For more information, see [table storage limits](/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-the-table-service-data-model). It is useful to know that the entity size cannot exceed 1 MB and a single property can be no bigger than 64 KB. These constraints make tables a good solution for storing a large number of small entities.

Drawing on the examples above, there is a known quantity of enrichments and data shapes that can be referenced in table projections. In the tables projection below, three tables are defined by setting the `tableName`, `source` and `generatedKeyName` properties.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| tableName | (Required) Determines the name of a new table created in Azure Table Storage. Tables are created with partitionKey and rowKey columns. |
| source | A path to a node in an enrichment tree. Because a table projection is complex (with multiple nodes populating multiple columns), the path should resolve to a data shape that includes the nodes. The output of a Shaper skill is the most common value for this property, but you can also create a shape using inline shaping within the projection. |
| generatedKeyName | Every row is uniquely identified by a system-generated value. This property determines the name of the column containing those values. If you omit this property, a column will be created automatically that uses the table name and "key" as the naming convention. |

All three of these tables will be related through generated keys and by the shared parent `/document/projectionShape`.

```json
"knowledgeStore" : {
    "storageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Acct Name>;AccountKey=<Acct Key>;",
    "projections": [
        {
            "tables": [
                {
                    "tableName": "tblDocument",
                    "generatedKeyName": "Documentid",
                    "source": "/document/projectionShape"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "tblKeyPhrases",
                    "generatedKeyName": "KeyPhraseid",
                    "source": "/document/projectionShape/keyPhrases/*"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "tblEntities",
                    "generatedKeyName": "Entityid",
                    "source": "/document/projectionShape/Entities/*"
                }
            ],
            "objects": [],
            "files": []
        }
    ]
}
```

You can process your work by following these steps:

1. Set the knowledge store's `storageConnectionString` property to a valid V2 general purpose storage account connection string.  

1. Update the skillset by issuing the PUT request.

1. After updating the skillset, run the indexer. 

You now have a working projection with three tables. [Importing these tables into Power BI](knowledge-store-connect-power-bi.md) should result in Power BI auto-discovering the relationships.

Before moving on to the next example, let's revisit aspects of the table projection to understand the mechanics of slicing and relating data.

### Slicing a table into multiple child tables

Slicing is a technique that subdivides a whole consolidated shape into constituent parts. The outcome consists of separate but related tables that you can work with individually.

In the example, `projectionShape` is the consolidated shape (or enrichment node). In the projection definition, `projectionShape` is sliced into additional tables, which enables you to pull out parts of the shape, `keyPhrases` and `Entities`. In Power BI, this is useful as multiple entities and keyPhrases are associated with each document, and you will get more insights if you can see entities and keyPhrases as categorized data.

Slicing implicitly generates a relationship between the parent and child tables, using the `generatedKeyName` in the parent table to create a column with the same name in the child table. 

### Naming relationships

The `generatedKeyName` and `referenceKeyName` properties are used to relate data across tables or even across projection types. Each row in the child table has a property pointing back to the parent. The name of the column or property in the child is the `referenceKeyName` from the parent. When the `referenceKeyName` is not provided, the service defaults it to the `generatedKeyName` from the parent. 

Power BI relies on these generated keys to discover relationships within the tables. If you need the column in the child table named differently, set the `referenceKeyName` property on the parent table. One example would be to set the `generatedKeyName` as ID on the tblDocument table and the `referenceKeyName` as DocumentID. This would result in the column in the tblEntities and tblKeyPhrases tables containing the document ID being named DocumentID.

## Projecting to objects

Object projections are simpler to define and are used when projecting whole documents. Object projections are limited to a single projection in a container and cannot be sliced.

To define an object projection, use the `objects` array in `projections`. You can generate a new shape using the Shaper skill or use inline shaping of the object projection. While the tables example demonstrated the approach of creating a shape and slicing, this example demonstrates the use of inline shaping. 

Inline shaping is the ability to create a new shape in the definition of the inputs to a projection. Inline shaping creates an anonymous object that is identical to what a Shaper skill would produce (in this case, `projectionShape`). Inline shaping is useful if you are defining a shape that you do not plan to reuse.

The projections property is an array. This example adds a new projection instance to the array, where the knowledgeStore definition contains inline projections. When using inline projections, you can omit the Shaper skill.

```json
"knowledgeStore" : {
    "storageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Acct Name>;AccountKey=<Acct Key>;",
    "projections": [
            {
            "tables": [ ],
            "objects": [
                {
                    "storageContainer": "sampleobject",
                    "source": null,
                    "generatedKeyName": "myobject",
                    "sourceContext": "/document",
                    "inputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "metadata_storage_name",
                            "source": "/document/metadata_storage_name"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "metadata_storage_path",
                            "source": "/document/metadata_storage_path"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "content",
                            "source": "/document/content"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "keyPhrases",
                            "source": "/document/merged_content/keyphrases/*"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "entities",
                            "source": "/document/merged_content/entities/*/name"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "ocrText",
                            "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/text"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "ocrLayoutText",
                            "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/layoutText"
                        }
                    ]

                }
            ],
            "files": []
        }
    ]
}
```

## Projecting to file

File projections are always images that are either extracted from the source document or outputs of enrichment that can be projected out of the enrichment process. File projections, similar to object projections, are implemented as blobs in Azure Storage, and contain the image. 

To generate a file projection, use the `files` array in the projection object. This example projects all images extracted from the document to a container called `myImages`.

```json
"knowledgeStore" : {
    "storageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Acct Name>;AccountKey=<Acct Key>;",
    "projections": [
        {
            "tables": [ ],
            "objects": [ ],
            "files": [
                {
                    "storageContainer": "myImages",
                    "source": "/document/normalized_images/*"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Projecting to multiple types

A more complex scenario might require you to project content across projection types. For example, projecting key phrases and entities to tables, saving OCR results of text and layout text as objects, and then projecting the images as files. 

Steps for multiple projection types:

1. Create a table with a row for each document.
1. Create a table related to the document table with each key phrase identified as a row in this table.
1. Create a table related to the document table with each entity identified as a row in this table.
1. Create an object projection with the layout text for each image.
1. Create a file projection, projecting each extracted image.
1. Create a cross-reference table that contains references to the document table, object projection with the layout text, and the file projection.

### Shape data for cross-projection

To get the shapes needed for these projections, start by adding a new Shaper skill that creates a shaped object called `crossProjection`. 

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ShaperSkill",
    "name": "ShaperForCrossProjection",
    "description": null,
    "context": "/document",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "metadata_storage_name",
            "source": "/document/metadata_storage_name",
            "sourceContext": null,
            "inputs": []
        },
        {
            "name": "keyPhrases",
            "source": null,
            "sourceContext": "/document/merged_content/keyphrases/*",
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "name": "KeyPhrases",
                    "source": "/document/merged_content/keyphrases/*"
                }

            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "entities",
            "source": null,
            "sourceContext": "/document/merged_content/entities/*",
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "name": "Entities",
                    "source": "/document/merged_content/entities/*/name"
                }

            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "images",
            "source": null,
            "sourceContext": "/document/normalized_images/*",
            "inputs": [
                {
                    "name": "image",
                    "source": "/document/normalized_images/*"
                },
                {
                    "name": "layoutText",
                    "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/layoutText"
                },
                {
                    "name": "ocrText",
                    "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/text"
                }
                ]
        }
 
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "name": "output",
            "targetName": "crossProjection"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Define table, object, and file projections

From the consolidated crossProjection object, slice the object into multiple tables, capture the OCR output as blobs, and then save the image as files (also in Blob storage).

```json
"knowledgeStore" : {
    "storageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Acct Name>;AccountKey=<Acct Key>;",
    "projections": [
            {
            "tables": [
                {
                    "tableName": "crossDocument",
                    "generatedKeyName": "Id",
                    "source": "/document/crossProjection"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "crossEntities",
                    "generatedKeyName": "EntityId",
                    "source": "/document/crossProjection/entities/*"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "crossKeyPhrases",
                    "generatedKeyName": "KeyPhraseId",
                    "source": "/document/crossProjection/keyPhrases/*"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "crossReference",
                    "generatedKeyName": "CrossId",
                    "source": "/document/crossProjection/images/*"
                }
                    
            ],
            "objects": [
                {
                    "storageContainer": "crossobject",
                    "generatedKeyName": "crosslayout",
                    "source": null,
                    "sourceContext": "/document/crossProjection/images/*/layoutText",
                    "inputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "OcrLayoutText",
                            "source": "/document/crossProjection/images/*/layoutText"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "files": [
                {
                    "storageContainer": "crossimages",
                    "generatedKeyName": "crossimages",
                    "source": "/document/crossProjection/images/*/image"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Object projections require a container name for each projection. Object projections and file projections cannot share a container. 

### Relationships among table, object, and file projections

This example also highlights another feature of projections. By defining multiple types of projections within the same projection object, there is a relationship expressed within and across the different types (tables, objects, files). This allows you to start with a table row for a document and find all the OCR text for the images within that document in the object projection. 

If you do not want the data related, define the projections in different projection groups. For example, the following snippet will result in the tables being related, but without relationships between the tables and the object (OCR text) projections. 

Projection groups are useful when you want to project the same data in different shapes for different needs. For example, a projection group for the Power BI dashboard, and another projection group for capturing data used to train a machine learning model wrapped in a custom skill.

When building projections of different types, file and object projections are generated first, and the paths are added to the tables.

```json
"knowledgeStore" : {
    "storageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<Acct Name>;AccountKey=<Acct Key>;",
    "projections": [
        {
            "tables": [
                {
                    "tableName": "unrelatedDocument",
                    "generatedKeyName": "Documentid",
                    "source": "/document/projectionShape"
                },
                {
                    "tableName": "unrelatedKeyPhrases",
                    "generatedKeyName": "KeyPhraseid",
                    "source": "/document/projectionShape/keyPhrases"
                }
            ],
            "objects": [
                
            ],
            "files": []
        }, 
        {
            "tables": [],
            "objects": [
                {
                    "storageContainer": "unrelatedocrtext",
                    "source": null,
                    "sourceContext": "/document/normalized_images/*/text",
                    "inputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "ocrText",
                            "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/text"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "storageContainer": "unrelatedocrlayout",
                    "source": null,
                    "sourceContext": "/document/normalized_images/*/layoutText",
                    "inputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "ocrLayoutText",
                            "source": "/document/normalized_images/*/layoutText"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "files": []
        }
    ]
}
```

## Common Issues

When defining a projection, there are a few common issues that can cause unanticipated results. Check for these issues if the output in knowledge store isn't what you expect.

+ Not shaping string enrichments into valid JSON. When strings are enriched, for example `merged_content` enriched with key phrases, the enriched property is represented as a child of `merged_content` within the enrichment tree. The default representation is not well-formed JSON. So at projection time, make sure to transform the enrichment into a valid JSON object with a name and a value.

+ Omitting the ```/*``` at the end of a source path. If the source of a projection is `/document/projectionShape/keyPhrases`, the key phrases array is projected as a single object/row. Instead, set the source path to `/document/projectionShape/keyPhrases/*` to yield a single row or object for each of the key phrases.

+ Path syntax errors. Path selectors are case-sensitive and can lead to missing input warnings if you do not use the exact case for the selector.

## Next steps

The examples in this article demonstrate common patterns on how to create projections. Now that you have a good understanding of the concepts, you are better equipped to build projections for your specific scenario.

As you explore new features, consider incremental enrichment as your next step. Incremental enrichment is based on caching, which lets you reuse any enrichments that are not otherwise affected by a skillset modification. This is especially useful for pipelines that include OCR and image analysis.
